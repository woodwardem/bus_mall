a project repo working on collecting data from pictures that were clicked. 


User Stories
1. As an end user, I want to click on one picture and then differant pictures show up. 
2. As a developer, I will use JS to render differant pictures onto the screen when certain ones are clicked. 

3. As an end user, I want the pictures to be spaced correctly, have padding, margins, and look pretty. 
4. As a developer, I will use CSS to make the website look apealing. I will use margins, padding, and either grid or flexbox to make all this happen. 
5. As an end user, I want to see the data of which ones I clicked the most.
6. As a developer, i will have to keep track of the number of clicks and the percentages. I want to make it so they can see their data after 25 clicks.
